# Aqua-Splunk Integration Demo Guide

This guide outlines how to demonstrate the Aqua-Splunk integration solution to customers.

## Prerequisites

Before running the demo, ensure you have:

1. Python 3.9+ installed
2. Required Python packages installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. `jq` command-line tool installed (for JSON parsing)

## Quick Demo Setup

1. Navigate to the vulnerability-filter-package directory:
   ```
   cd vulnerability-filter-package
   ```

2. Run the interactive demo script:
   ```
   ./demo.sh
   ```

3. The demo will guide you through each feature with colorful, interactive prompts.

## Demo Walkthrough

The demo showcases three key features:

### 1. Severity-Based Filtering

This demonstrates how we filter vulnerabilities based on CVSS score (â‰¥ 7.0) to focus on high-severity issues only. You'll see:
- The original number of vulnerabilities
- The number after filtering
- The data volume reduction percentage

**Key Talking Points:**
- Enables focusing on critical security issues
- Dramatically reduces Splunk license consumption
- Prioritizes remediation efforts

### 2. Delta Reporting

This shows how we can identify only new vulnerabilities since the last scan. You'll see:
- A simulated new vulnerability being detected
- Complete details of the new finding
- How this helps track emerging security issues

**Key Talking Points:**
- Reduces alert fatigue by showing only what's changed
- Enables tracking of newly discovered issues
- Provides efficient security monitoring workflows

### 3. Splunk Event Format

This demonstrates how the data is transformed into a Splunk-friendly format. You'll see:
- The flat structure of individual events
- How complex nested data is simplified
- The fields included for effective searching

**Key Talking Points:**
- Optimized for Splunk's indexing and search capabilities
- One event per vulnerability for clear reporting
- Standardized format for consistent querying

## Custom Demo Scenarios

To adapt the demo for specific customer needs:

### For Large Enterprises with License Concerns

Emphasize the data reduction percentage and how this translates to Splunk license savings.

### For DevSecOps Teams

Focus on the delta reporting and how it integrates with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security monitoring.

### For Security Operations

Highlight the optimized Splunk format and how it enables better security monitoring and incident response.

## Next Steps After Demo

1. Discuss integration options:
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Scheduled jobs
   - API-triggered processing

2. Review customer's specific Splunk environment:
   - HEC token configuration
   - Index and sourcetype planning
   - Dashboard requirements

3. Provide implementation timeline and support options

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the demo:

- **No data displayed**: Verify the Aqua scan report exists in the expected location
- **jq command not found**: Install jq (`brew install jq` on macOS, `apt install jq` on Ubuntu)
- **Python errors**: Verify all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
